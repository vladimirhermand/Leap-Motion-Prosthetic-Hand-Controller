# Leap Motion Robotic Hand Controller
 Leap Motion Robotic Hand Controller using node.js
 
 -- INSTRUCTIONS --
 
 This is all based on this project https://www.instructables.com/id/Robotic-Hand-controlled-by-Gesture-with-Arduino-Le/
 
 It is just adapted to work with another prosthetic hand, the brunel hand 2.0 by OpenBionics.
 
 Follow all the instructions in the link and replace the script and the lib folders with the ones in this repository. 
 
 I kept the original app from user Acali on Instructables but changed its name to app_original and made some slight modifications to the handToHand file in the lib folder in order to make it work with this prosthetic hand.
 
 My version is the one called app.js in the Script folder in this Repository.
